# Socials Photo Formatter
This tool is designed to format your photos so social media apps like Instagram will not screw over the aspect ratio or crop them in unwanted ways.
It puts your photos onto a square canvas, which works specifically well for Instagram posts and maybe other social media platforms.

**Live app**: [https://photo.graaf.dev/](https://photo.graaf.dev/)

## Features
- Transform any photo into a square format without altering the original aspect ratio.
- Compress images to reduce file size because social media platforms often have file size limits.
- Completely client-side processing, ensuring your photos remain private and secure.

## Why?
This seems like a common problem, isn't this already solved? Well, yes, but I could not find a solution that was either free to use or not riddled with ads. So I made my own!
